A simple code exploration, inspired by (and stollen from) Bj√∂rn Staal and Momcilo Popov. [More info here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7133171531567816705/).

# Running the Experiment Locally

## Install Dependencies:

1. Install WebSocket server and Frontend dependencies:

```
npm run installAll
```

If you want to install only the Frontend dependencies:

```
npm run installFrontend
```

2. Run the application:

```
npm run dev
```

If you only want to run the application with local storage, use:

```
npm run client
```

## Two Methods to Run the Application:

### Method 1: Using WebSocket

Open the WebSocket version in two separate tabs:

Tab 1: http://localhost:3000?id=1

Tab 2: http://localhost:3000?id=2

### Method 2: Using LocalStorage

Open the LocalStorage version in separate tabs:

Tab 1: http://localhost:3000/local/1

Tab 2: http://localhost:3000/local/2

Tab 3: http://localhost:3000/local/3

By following these steps, you should be able to run the experiment locally with WebSocket or LocalStorage, depending on your preference.
