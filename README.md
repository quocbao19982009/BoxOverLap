How to run this experiment locally:

## Install dependencies:

1. Install WS server and Frontend: `npm run installAll`.
2. Run application: `npm run dev `. If you only want to run the application with local storage, run `npm run client` and than follow step 4.

## Two method to run the application:

1. Using Websocket: Open `localhost:8080?b=1` in one tab, and Open `localhost:8080?b=2` in another tab
2. Using LocalStorage: Open `localhost:8080/local/1` in one tab, and Open `localhost:8080/local/2` in another tab and Open `localhost:8080/local/3` in another tab
